### Laboratory for Internal Combustion Engines and Electromobility at Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ljubljana.


The research and teaching activities of the Laboratory with more than 50 years of experiences focus on:

- Multi-scale and multi domain battery models,
- Multi-scale and multi domain fuel cell models,
- Advanced SoX observer for batteries and fuel cells based on reduced dimensionality real-time capable physics based models,
- Advanced waste to energy concepts,
- Advanced and alternative fuels and combustion concepts,
- Advanced system levels tools for sector coupling systems and multi-energy systems.

Our vision is development of innovative basic and applied scientific contributions and their implementation into industrial and/or socially beneficial projects.
